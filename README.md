# MDN First-Splash

The "first splash" tutorial on the Mozilla Developer Network's site to learn Javascript and its integration with HTML, CSS, and web development.

Also I am aware the HTML, CSS and Javascript can be written as separate files and connected to the HTML with a different link and script tag, but I have kept it the way it is to remain true to the walkthrough.
